8/12/16
A calculator made in JavaFX with, currently, three functions: standard, algebraic, and linear equation.

If you are on Windows, use "src for Windows".
If you are on Linux, use "src for Ubuntu".
The only difference is GUI tweaks so that they look the smae on the two operating systems.

A calculator history can be recorded if the following files are created:
  Create a folder named "calculator" on your Desktop.
    In calculator, create a folder named "equation" and a text file named "algebraic".
      In equation, create two text files: "Single" and "Linear".
