A calculator made in JavaFX with, many functions. Standard, algebraic, equation and systems of equations, Inequality and systems of inequalities, and graphing.

IN ORDER FOR CALCULATOR TO WORK, YOU NEED MY ALGEBRAIC LIBRARY FOUND HERE: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/270687824/Alib.jar

The source code can also be found in my Algebra Library repository.

A calculator history can be recorded if the following files are created:
Create a folder named "calculator" on your desktop.
In calculator, create three files: equation.txt, algebraic.txt, and inequality.txt.
These will record histories of the equations, algebraic expressions, and inequalities you solve with the calculator.
