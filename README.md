8/12/16
A calculator made in JavaFX with, currently, three functions: standard, algebraic, and equation (Both single-variable and systems of equations).

A calculator history can be recorded if the following files are created:
Create a folder named "calculator" on your desktop.
In calculator, create three files: equation.txt, algebraic.txt, and inequality.txt.
These will record histories of the equations, algebraic expressions, and inequalities you solve with the calculator.
