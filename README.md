# Calculator
8/12/16
A calculator made in JavaFX with various functions including an algebraic mode and equation and inequality solving.

In order for the calculator to work, you need my algebraic library found here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/270687824/Alib.jar

I also have a repository of the library source code here: https://github.com/CalebTaber/Algebra-Library

A calculator history can be recorded by creating the following files
(Mostly for bug tracking in the algrebra library, but also gives step-by-step solutions):
Create a folder named "calculator" on your desktop.
In calculator, create three files: equation.txt, algebraic.txt, and inequality.txt.
